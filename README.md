## Preprocessing

I've included preprocessing code. It's done in python. You don't have to use it since this repo contains all files created during preprocessing.

## Visualization

You have to install processing - https://processing.org/ 
After installation check if you can run any example:

  1. Go File>Examples
  2. Open any example (Simulations are cool: Topics>Simulate)
  3. Run it (Circle "play" button)

If this works open app from this repository:

  1. File>open
  2. Go to app directory
  3. Open app.pde

Run it. 

The sketch use parallel coordinates and map. This is hat I manage to do in two days.
